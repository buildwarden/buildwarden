# The Loop Contract: finished against the running loop, with `docs/development/` split into project invariants and loop rules

This is the first of the two items of phase P1 of the componentization
program ([`componentization`](componentization.md), a program item under
FLOW-20). It finishes the Loop Contract and splits the standards. The second
item, `loop-repository`, creates the loop repository and moves things into
it. This design says what the first hands to the second.

## Problem

BuildWarden's loop has rules for one repository. They are in
`docs/development/process.md` (FLOW-01 to FLOW-20) and
`docs/development/behavioral-linter.md` (LINT-01 to LINT-08), enforced by
`wf` (`tools/workflow/`), tier 1 (`tools/tier1/`), four skills and six agent
definitions under `.claude/`, with state on the `workflow` branch. All of it
names this repository's paths, commands and rules: `make lint`, `docs/design/`,
`overview.md`, GLOBAL-06, the drivers.

The componentization program gives every component its own repository and
its own queue (Decision 2 there), and moves the loop to its own public
repository (Decision 13). The relay repository already exists, is written in
Rust, and has "the Loop Contract adopted" in its first milestone (M1). What it
would adopt today is Jeff's draft of 2026-11-07, a document outside any
repository: eight sections with "fill in" markers and research tasks that ask
what the running loop actually does, and several statements that the running
loop has since settled differently.

Three things are missing:

1. **A finished contract.** The draft's blanks filled from the loop as it
   runs, each disagreement between the draft and the loop resolved, and the
   one new process the program needs written down: work that changes a seam
   changes its specification first (Decision 13), beside the design-first
   rule this repository already has (FLOW-01).
2. **A line through `docs/development/`.** Which rules are this project's own
   invariants and stay, and which are loop rules and move. The umbrella says
   "FLOW-*, LINT-*: move to the loop repository as the Loop Contract's
   detail" and leaves the rest to P1.
3. **A way for a second component to read rules written for this one.** The
   relay cannot run `make lint` or update `overview.md`. The contract has to
   say what is the component's to define, and must not assume a language or
   a toolchain.

This item holds no worker (its queue file has no `holds`), so nothing in its
PR may disrupt running work: S1 (`seam-specs`) and K1 (`driver-contract`) are
in Design now and will run under whatever this merges.

## Prior art

- [`componentization`](componentization.md): the umbrella. Its Decision 2
  (a repository and a queue per component), Decision 13 (the loop repository;
  work is both spec-first and design-first), Decision 18 (a rule changes in
  the item that makes it true), seam 10 (the Loop Contract), phase P1 and the
  row "FLOW-*, LINT-*: move to the loop repository as the Loop Contract's
  detail" are what this design carries out. Where Jeff's draft (2026-11-07)
  and the umbrella (approved 2026-11-12) disagree, the umbrella is later and
  wins; each case is listed under **The draft against the running loop**.
- [`workflow-bootstrap`](workflow-bootstrap.md) stood the loop up: the
  `workflow` branch, `wf`, the skills and agents, FLOW-18's guard.
  [`workflow-streamline`](workflow-streamline.md) gave it one feature round,
  the design review and process items. The contract describes the loop those
  two built, and does not redesign it.
- [`native-host-loop`](native-host-loop.md): the scheduled native sessions,
  `hosts.yaml`, `wf gate`, and the rule that the scheduler on each machine is
  installed by hand. The draft's section 5 is filled from it.
- [`design-approved-rule-changes`](design-approved-rule-changes.md): the two
  routes by which a rule changes (FLOW-14). This design narrows the second
  route for loop rules (LOOP-09, a10).
- [`regression-fixes-follow-up`](regression-fixes-follow-up.md): FLOW-05's
  four classes. The draft has two; the four stand (a4).
- [`tier1-static-checks`](tier1-static-checks.md): the rule index
  (`tools/tier1/rules`), `rules.yaml`, the `seam-contract` and `schema-doc`
  checks. The split is shaped so that none of them changes in this PR.
- [`specs-migration`](specs-migration.md): the layout of `specs/` and
  RELAY-05, which is what the running loop has today in place of the draft's
  specification handling.
- `seam-specs` (S1, in Design on `feat/seam-specs`, not yet reviewed)
  proposes how a seam change is ordered across two repositories and how this
  repository pins a specifications release. The contract states the order
  and leaves the pin to the component (LOOP-02), so it does not depend on how
  that review ends.

Outside this repository, read for this design and not changed by it:

- **The Loop Contract draft**, Jeff, 2026-11-07
  (https://claude.ai/artifact/UY5WXovAA5phiAHU4LDbK9, read at revision 7).
  Its eight sections, two decided points and five blanks are the starting
  material.
- **The relay fork's decisions table** (read at revision 20) and
  **kickoff** (revision 12), both 2026-11-07, for what the relay's loop
  needs: decisions 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 16 of the table, and the kickoff's
  "Loop contract" and "Design constraints" sections.
- **`buildwarden/buildwarden-relay`** at `cc40728` (`feat/m1-foundation`): a
  placeholder README, `docs/design/m1-foundation.md` started with three
  front-matter keys, and no rules, queue, agents or build files yet.
