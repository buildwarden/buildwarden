# Seam specifications and conformance suites (componentization S1)

This is a program item (FLOW-20): phase S1 of
[`componentization`](componentization.md). That design fixes what S1 is:
create `buildwarden/buildwarden-specs` (a10), write seams 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6,
build a conformance harness that runs black-box against any relay binary or
image and against any collector, link the book and the specs both ways, and
fill `seams` in `tools/tier1/rules.yaml`. It is done when the suites pass
against the Go relay and the disk collector. This design works inside those
decisions and does not reopen them.

## Problem

Five of the seams between BuildWarden's components exist only as Go code:

| # | Seam | Where it is defined today |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Claim protocol (`relay-claim`) | `relaycfg/` and its package comment; what each relay mode does with a claim is in `cmd/relay/` |
| 2 | Collector protocol (`collector`) | `collector/` and its package comment; the relay's side is `relay/collector_client.go` |
| 3 | Relay guest API (`relay-guest-api`) | `relay/relay.go` (`handleArtifacts`, `handleContextGet`), `relay/controlplane.go`, `relay/dns.go`, `relay/heartbeat.go`, `cmd/relay/dhcp.go` |
| 5 | `initialize` contract (`executor-initialize`) | `cmd/warden-io/main.go`, `initialize.go`, `baseline.go`, `platform_<os>.go` |
| 6 | Bootstrap config (`bootstrap-config`) | `bootstrap/bootstrap.go` |

Three things follow.

- The Rust relay (`buildwarden/buildwarden-relay`) has to implement seams 1,
  2, 3 and 6 and has nothing to implement them from but another
  implementation. Its milestone M1 takes its conformance harness from this
  item.
- GLOBAL-08 and EXEC-04 say a change to a versioned seam also changes the
  seam's contract document, and tier 1's `seam-contract` check enforces that
  for the seams `rules.yaml` lists. The list is empty, because there are no
  documents. PR #115 changed the claim (`upstream_dns`, the claim token on
  Hyper-V) with nothing to update.
- TEST-05 asks for conformance tests "so a third-party substitute has
  something to verify against". The tests that exist are Go unit tests that
  import the packages under test. A relay in another language cannot run
  them, and neither can a third party who has only a binary.

## Prior art

- [`componentization`](componentization.md): Decisions 2 and 3 (components
  coupled through written seams and tagged releases; specifications with
  black-box suites in their own repository), "a phase that touches a seam
  changes the seam's specification first, then the code", Decision 18 (a rule
  changes in the item that makes it true), a1 (the collector specification in
  two parts), a10 and a11 (the repository's name, and who creates it). Its
  Consolidation records what #115 added to the claim and to BOOT-06; the
  specifications describe `main` with both.
- [`specs-migration`](specs-migration.md) and
  [`relay05-specs-wording`](relay05-specs-wording.md): the layout of `specs/`
  (one directory per document family, `v<N>.md` beside `v<N>.schema.json`,
  an index in `README.md`), the rule that a schema's `$id` is a name and not a
  location, and the tier-0 test that ties the producer to the documents. The
  specs repository uses the same layout, extended (Decision 2).
- [`tier1-static-checks`](tier1-static-checks.md) built `seam-contract` and
  kept its seam list as data in `rules.yaml`, "so new seams edit data, not
  code". This item fills the list and changes no check code.
- [`build-link-subnet`](build-link-subnet.md) (the claim's `build_link`, what
  each mode does with it, the refusal that leaves a relay claimable) and
  [`hyperv-relay-per-build-channel`](hyperv-relay-per-build-channel.md)
  (`upstream_dns`, the claim token, RELAY-08, BOOT-06's boot channel) are the
  two designs whose text the claim specification is checked against.
- [`unified-bootstrap`](unified-bootstrap.md): `GET /bootstrap` and the
  `bootstrap` package (seam 6), and the baseline `initialize` applies.
- [`relay-leaf-crl`](relay-leaf-crl.md): `/ca.crl` on the reserved host and
  the CRL distribution point in every leaf (seam 3).
- [`ledger-environment-types`](ledger-environment-types.md): the claim's
  `environment` and the collector's `PUT /v1/environment`.
- [`design-approved-rule-changes`](design-approved-rule-changes.md): the
  route by which this design's four rule changes are approved by name.

All ten already carry front-matter; no retrofit is needed (FLOW-12).

Outside this repository: `buildwarden-relay` `main` at `e9b23d5`
(`spike/REPORT.md`). What the harness takes from it is in **What a relay under
test must provide**: the Rust relay's build link is raw Ethernet frames on a
socket, and its claim will arrive over vsock on VZ.
